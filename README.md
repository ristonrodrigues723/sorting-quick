This repository contains the source code for a web-based visualizer that demonstrates the quicksort algorithm in an interactive manner. Users can input numbers, generate random arrays, and visualize the sorting process step-by-step.

Features:

Number Input: Users can enter numbers manually.
Random Array Generation: Generates random arrays of specified size.
Array Manipulation: Users can add and remove numbers from the array.
Quicksort Visualization: The visualizer animates the quicksort algorithm, highlighting comparisons and swaps.
Performance Metrics: Displays the number of comparisons and swaps made during the sorting process.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Defines the structure and content of the web page.
CSS: Styles the visual appearance of the website elements.
JavaScript: Handles user interactions, data manipulation, and visualization of the quicksort algorithm.
Getting Started:

Clone the Repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/ristonrodrigues723/interactive-quicksort-visualizer.git
Use code with caution.

Open in a Web Browser: Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
Usage:

Enter Numbers: Input numbers into the input field and click "Add Number" to add them to the array.
Generate Random Array: Click "Generate Random Array" to create a random array of a specified size.
Run Quicksort: Click "Run Quicksort" to start the visualization. The algorithm will be animated, showing comparisons and swaps.
View Statistics: The "Stats" section displays the number of comparisons and swaps performed during the sorting process.
